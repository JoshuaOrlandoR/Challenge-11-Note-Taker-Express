  ## Description
  Life can get very busy, and having a way to plan or organize the various tasks you need to accomplish can make things much easier. This simple app, powered by express, aims to aid users with this organization. This note taker app allows users to easily store and delete notes, through a backend, unlike a similar agenda app I created in the past, which utilized the local storage to accomplish similar organizing. 

  ## Requirements
  This app is powered by the NodeJS framework, ExpressJS. Users will need to ensure Node is on their machine in order to begin the application.  

  ## Installation
  To install the application, users can download or clone this git repository to their local machine. They can run this on their local machine by opening the downloaded repository in a coding enviornment, like VS Code, and opening a terminal. In this terminal, type "npm i" to install all needed dependencies. Then type "npm start" to launch the server to the given local port. They can open this port in any browser by typing "localhost:3001" in their search bar. Alternatively, users can proceed to the heroku link to launch the application!

  ## Useage
  The app is straightforward to use. Once opened, click the "Get started" button, this will take users to the notes page. While on this page, users can enter a title for a note and the note text in their represented fields. Once satisfied with the content of the note, users can click the floppy disk icon to save the note to the left side of the screen. To remove a note, click the red trashcan button next to the note.
